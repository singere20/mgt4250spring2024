### Questions of interest
- Q1
- Q2
- Q3
Our team plans to solve the question of: “how can we find the right customer
segments to target our marketing eBorts towards?” This question is import as a business
can implement more clear and concise targeting objectives for the marketing team, as well
as increased operational eBiciency. DoorDash, the most popular online food ordering
service, has already began to introduce analytics, as the CFO stated, “we can run an
experiment and actually quantify the true impact that it had on the business…[from] a new
carousel on the home page to our release of the pickup map in the DoorDash app.”1
Analytics, and visualizations made from those analytics can help improve business
eBiciencies and customization eBorts for these types of businesses.

## Data Description & Upload
We chose to use a dataset from an online food ordering platform. The data was
obtained in a csv format from the website Kaggle, and can be downloaded by clicking here.
The columns that will be used in visualizations are age, family size, occupation, and
feedback. Age is a continuous variable that represents the age in years of the customer.
Family size is a continuous variable that represents the number of individuals in the
customer’s family. Occupation is a string and labels the occupation of the customer as
either student, employed, housewife or self-employed. Finally, feedback is a binary
variable representing types of feedback with values of either positive or negative.

## Interpreting Visualizations
<img width="601" alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-02 at 5 56 37 PM" src="https://github.com/singere20/mgt4250spring2024/assets/55157734/d2f188e9-0c82-4ae1-8d60-a083db113841">

The first figure is a histogram titled “Distribution of Occupations”. This visualization
helps us understand our data and our customers better. By knowing occupation statistics,
we can start to make educated guesses on which occupation to target for marketing
purposes.

The second plot is a scatter plot with age on the x-axis, family size on the y-axis and
feedback as the color. This plot was created to see if there was any correlation between
age and family size. This would allow the marketing team to get an idea of the ideal
customer to target marketing eBorts towards.

The third graph is a symbol map displaying diBerent clusters by color. The clusters
were made using the age, family size, and feedback columns. This is helpful to see
customers with similar demographics that responded positively or negatively to their order.
This further focuses our target market and gives us a profile of the typical customer who
responded well so that we can spend our eBort and energy on specific groups of
customers.
