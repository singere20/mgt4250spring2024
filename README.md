This is the final project for course MGT4250 at Elon University
### Questions of interest
- What are the different segments of customers we have?
- How can we find the right customer segments to target our marketing efforts towards?
### Importance
- Implement more clear and concise targeting objectives with improved customization efforts
- Increased operational efficiency
- DoorDash: “we can run an experiment and actually quantify the true impact that it had on the business… from a new
carousel on the home page to our release of the pickup map in the DoorDash app.”[^1]

## Data Description & Upload
We chose to use a dataset from an online food ordering platform. The data was
obtained in a csv format from the website Kaggle, and can be downloaded by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudarshan24byte/online-food-dataset).
### Variable Explanation
- Age: Continuous variable that represents the age in years of the customer
- Family size: Continuous variable that represents the number of individuals in the customer’s family. 
- Occupation: String variable based on the occupation of the customer (student, employed, housewife or self-employed).
- Feedback: Binary variable representing types of feedback with values of either positive or negative.

## Interpreting Visualizations
<img width="601" alt="Screen Shot 2024-05-02 at 5 56 37 PM" src="https://github.com/singere20/mgt4250spring2024/assets/55157734/d2f188e9-0c82-4ae1-8d60-a083db113841">

The first figure is a histogram titled “Distribution of Occupations”. This visualization
helps us understand our data and our customers better. By knowing occupation statistics,
we can start to make educated guesses on which occupation to target for marketing
purposes.

The second plot is a scatter plot with age on the x-axis, family size on the y-axis and
feedback as the color. This plot was created to see if there was any correlation between
age and family size. This would allow the marketing team to get an idea of the ideal
customer to target marketing eBorts towards.

The third graph is a symbol map displaying diBerent clusters by color. The clusters
were made using the age, family size, and feedback columns. This is helpful to see
customers with similar demographics that responded positively or negatively to their order.
This further focuses our target market and gives us a profile of the typical customer who
responded well so that we can spend our eBort and energy on specific groups of
customers.
